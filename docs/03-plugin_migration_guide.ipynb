    "\n",
    "In the following we present guidelines on how to migrate your existing plugin to use the new AiiDA data types delivered in the `aiida-atomistic` code.\n",
    "This mainly has to do with the `properties` attribute of new atomistic `StructureData` nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main changes from the `orm` to the `atomistic` StructureData\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main differences which you should take into account when migrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `properties` attribute (a subclass of the [pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/))\n",
    "- immutability of `StructureData`\n",
    "- site-based approach to define the properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The `properties` attribute in the new `atomistic` StructureData allows you to store additional information associated with each site/atom in the structure. \n",
    "To migrate your plugin, you need to update your code to access and manipulate the `properties` attribute instead of the previous methods.\n",
    "This is needed for all the properties, even the old ones, now under the `properties` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pbc: `structure.properties.pbc`\n",
    "- cell: `structure.properties.cell`\n",
    "- sites: `structure.properties.sites`\n",
    "\n",
    "... and so on. A full list of properties can be accessed via the *classmethod* `get_supported_properties`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the `StructureData` nodes in the `atomistic` module are now immutable even before being stored in the database. This means that you cannot modify the structure once it is created. If you need to make changes, you should create a new `StructureDataMutable` which allows you to modify the properties. This can be done via the `to_mutable` method. Once finished, you can invoke the `to_immutable` method of the `StructureDataMutable` to have the update instance of the `StructureData` class. For further details, please have a look at the dedicated [section](mikibonacci.github.io/aiida-atomistic/structuredata#mutation-of-a-structuredatamutable-instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Site-based approach: `Kind` class is dropped\n",
    "\n",
    "All the properties are defined in site-base approach, i.e. we do no more support the kind-based mapping. This is less compact description but allows a code-agnostic way definition of properties.\n",
    "The mapping to kinds can always be done afterwards (i.e. in the `aiida-quantumespresso` plugin).\n",
    "Now the kinds are just a property of the structure, as well as all the others. So, each site will have a `kind_name` property, being `kinds` the (on-the-fly derived) property which contains the list of the kind of each site. \n",
    "Kinds can be generated on demand using the `get_kinds` or other methods (see the dedicated [section](https://mikibonacci.github.io/aiida-atomistic/structuredata#automatic-kinds-generation)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward compatiblity\n",
    "\n",
    "For some backward compatibility support, refer to the [documentation](mikibonacci.github.io/aiida-atomistic/structuredata#backward-compatibility-support).\n",
    "The support for the old `orm.StructureData` is meant to be dropped soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a plugin should behave: parsing the structure properties for input file generation\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `StructureData` in your plugin, the idea is that each defined properties should be used in the calculation. The rationale is that, in this way, we have no ambiguity about if a property was used or not in the job.\n",
    "For example, if we use a structure with defined `magmoms`, the related DFT simulation submitted should be a magnetic one. It sounds confusing if a non-magnetic calculation was done using a magnetic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check on the supported properties, the plugin should define somewhere a list of supported ones, and control against the list of defined properties for a given `StructureData`. In particular, there are some properties which are computed by default and do not require to be inspected: \"cell\", \"pbc\" and so on. The properties to be checked are the one effectively extend the structure: \"magmoms\", \"charges\" and so on. Full list of such properties can be printed using the `get_supported_properties` method, setting the input parameter `for_plugin_check=True`:"

    "\n",
    "### Dealing with unsupported properties\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your plugin does not support (for example) magnetic calculations, but the structure contains `magmoms` in its properties? \n",
    "We recommend two solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `except` with some error (for example `NotImplementedError`), maybe even returning an AiiDA `exit_code` (depending on when you perform the check);\n",
    "- `raise` a `Warning` and using a `calcfunction` to generate a new `StructureData` without the given unsupported set of properties;\n",

    "In the first case, the plugin will stop and except. Let's take the example of the `aiida-quantumespresso` `PwCalculation`. We provide a check in the super class  `BasePwCpInputGenerator`.\n",
    "We suggest to put the properties validation in a `validate_inputs` *classmethod*. We define the list of `_supported_properties` as class attribute of the `BasePwCpInputGenerator`, and we include the following code snippet in the `validate_inputs` method (which is invoked in the corresponding method of the subclass):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BasePwCpInputGenerator(CalcJob):\n",
    "    \"\"\"`CalcJob` implementation for the pw.x code of Quantum ESPRESSO.\"\"\"\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "    ...\n",
    "        \"\"\"Check if the structure if the atomistic `StructureData` and \n",
    "        if contains unsupported properties\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        if isinstance(value['structure'], LegacyStructureData):\n",
    "            raise exceptions.InputValidationError('LegacyStructureData (orm.StructureData) is no more supported, \\\n",
    "                use StructureData instead. You can convert a LegacyStructureData to a \\\n",
    "                StructureData using the `to_atomistic` method of the legacy.')\n",

    "                raise NotImplementedError(f'The input structure contains one or more unsupported properties \\\n",

    "```\n",

    "In this way, each subclass of `BasePwCpInputGenerator` will perform the check on the same set of supported properties. You can define for each subclass the `StructureData` check, in case they support different properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case we just raise a Warning and produce a new `StructureData` without the unsupported properties. This approach is better suited for a `WorkChain`, in which we may want to perform again the check and stripe on the fly the properties we don't want. \n",
    "Using as example the `PwBaseWorkChain`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PwBaseWorkChain(ProtocolMixin, BaseRestartWorkChain):\n",

    "            # Generate a new StructureData without the unsupported properties.\n",
    "            self.inputs.pw.structure = generate_striped_structure(self.inputs.pw.structure, orm.List(list(plugin_check)))\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `generate_striped_structure` is a `calcfunction`, so provenance is still preserved here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom properties should be taken into account as well (see the [dedicated section](custom-properties)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom properties\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are the ones not officially supported in the `atomistic` package. \n",
    "They should be defined *only* if the given calcjob/plugin supports them, meaning that they will be\n",
    "used in the calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If instead one just wants to attach more information to a `StructureData` node, but not use it in any of the simulations,\n",
    "it is possible to set the extras:\n",
    "\n",

    "structure.base.extras.set(\"property_1\", [1,2,3,4])\n",
